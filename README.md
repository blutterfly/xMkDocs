Documentation using MkDocs, Python and Github Pages

Step 1: Install MkDocs
First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install MkDocs:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
```
Step 2: Create a New MkDocs Project
Navigate to your project directory and create a new MkDocs project:

```bash
mkdocs new my-docs
cd my-docs
```
This command creates a new directory my-docs with a sample MkDocs project.

Step 3: Choose a Theme
MkDocs comes with a default theme, but you can switch to the Read the Docs theme by editing the mkdocs.yml file in your project directory:

```yaml
site_name: My Project Documentation
theme: readthedocs
```
Step 4: Write Your Documentation
Add your documentation files in Markdown format to the docs directory. You can organize your documentation into sections and pages by editing the mkdocs.yml file. Here's an example configuration:

```
site_name: My Project Documentation
theme: readthedocs
nav:
    - Home: index.md
    - About: about.md
```

Step 5: Preview Your Site Locally
MkDocs includes a built-in server that lets you preview your site in real-time as you work on it:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

You can view your site by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your web browser.

Step 6: Deploy Your Site to GitHub Pages
First, ensure your MkDocs project is in a GitHub repository. MkDocs simplifies the deployment process to GitHub Pages:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This command builds your site and pushes it to the gh-pages branch of your GitHub repository. GitHub Pages will automatically detect this and serve your site from there.

Remember to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings, choosing the gh-pages branch as your source.
